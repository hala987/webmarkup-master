            <h3 class="header">Haarlem</h3>
            <p class="first-p">Haarlem has been the historical centre of the tulip bulb-growing district for centuries and bears its other nickname 'Bloemenstad' (flower city) for this reason.
                Haarlem has a rich history dating back to pre-medieval times, as it lies on a thin strip of land above sea level known as the strandwal (beach ridge), which connects Leiden to Alkmaar. The people on this narrow strip of land struggled against the waters of the North Sea from the west, and the waters of the IJ and the Haarlem Lake from the east. Haarlem became wealthy with toll revenues that it collected from ships and travellers moving on this busy North-South route.

The vleeshal and the vishal are located here, as well as the City Hall where wedding ceremonies are held, and newlyweds pose for pictures on the ancient steps. Several main streets connect to the Grote Markt, one of which takes you do the main train station (approx. 10-minute walk) North, while the Grote Hout Straat is the main shopping street going South, paralleled by the Kleine Houtstraat which has the smaller boutiques and little cafe's.
