            <h3 class="header">Haarlem</h3>
            <p class="p">Haarlem has been the historical centre of the tulip bulb-growing district for centuries and bears its other nickname 'Bloemenstad' (flower city) for this reason.
                Haarlem has a rich history dating back to pre-medieval times, as it lies on a thin strip of land above sea level known as the strandwal (beach ridge), which connects Leiden to Alkmaar. The people on this narrow strip of land struggled against the waters of the North Sea from the west, and the waters of the IJ and the Haarlem Lake from the east. Haarlem became wealthy with toll revenues that it collected from ships and travellers moving on this busy North-South route.

            <h3 class="header"> Haarlem Noord </h3>
            <p class="p"> is a city district of the Dutch municipality of Haarlem with more than 56,000 inhabitants. Until 1927, the area was for the most part part of the former municipality of Schoten.

                The area just north of Haarlem station had already been annexed in 1884. Here, the Frans Halsbuurt and Kleverparkbuurt were quickly built. Construction of the Ripperdakazerne was started in 1882. After the annexation of Schoten, the former municipality is almost completely built up within 25 years. There are often single-family homes from the 30s, 40s and 50s of the 20th century. The Rijksstraatweg goes in the middle of Haarlem-Noord towards Velsen. Parallel to the Rijksstraatweg is the Cronjéstraat shopping street at the start of the district. To the west, Haarlem-Noord is bounded by the Westelijke Randweg, east by the Vondelweg and Spaarndamseweg. </p>
